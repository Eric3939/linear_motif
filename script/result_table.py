# This table listed the predicted motifs using our linear motif prediction tool, specifing the infomation content and the four feature scores, calculated by averaging all residues in the motif.  
# Note 1: The four feature scores are z-normalize.
# Note 2: The information content is calculated from the match states of the HMM, the calculation is described in the paper
# Note 3: Only the confident predictions are presented here. To see all the predictions, including the filtered ones, either toggle the filter variable to False in the python script and generate a new table, or directly access the original pickle files.
